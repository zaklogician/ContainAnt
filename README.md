**ContainAnt** is an IoC container on steroids: by placing advanced search-based
heuristics at the heart of dependency injection, it automatically configures your
components for optimal performance and behavior.

## Pastelized: an adaptive color scheme

Written in less than 200LOC using **ContainAnt**, Pastelized is a syntax
highlighting color scheme that react to changes in background color while 
maintaining readability and preserving its main aesthetic principles.

* Minor changes don't affect anything:
![Dark Purple Pastelized Scheme](/res/cs3/1.png?raw=true "Minor changes don't affect anything")

* As the background becomes brighter, the colors subtly change to maintain readability

* As the purple text turns red, its complementary green pair drifts towards cyan. Aesthetics are preserved.
