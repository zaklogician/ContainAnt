# ContainAnt

Companion repository for the paper
"On Dependency Injection and Programming by Optimization".

**ContainAnt** is an IoC container on steroids: by placing advanced search-based
heuristics at the heart of dependency injection, it automatically configures your
components for optimal performance and behavior.

## Adaptive Syntax Highlighting

**ContainAnt** can automatically choose and instantiate a readable syntax
highlighting scheme for any background color. You literally just write
`ContainAnt create[SyntaxHighlighter]`, and let **ContainAnt** worry about
the configuration.
